        <h1>What is the question-behavior effect?</h1>
        <p>For 40 years, consumer psychologists have explored the nature of the question-behavior effect (QBE). A new meta-analysis of the effect finds varying support for four over-arching theoretical mechanisms: attitudes, consistency, fluency, &amp; motivations.</p>
        <p>In brief, the QBE is a behavioral influence technique whereby asking people about the future performance of a behavior changes the likelihood of performing the questioned behavior in the future.</p>
